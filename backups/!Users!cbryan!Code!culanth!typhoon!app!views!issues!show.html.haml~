        %p In the January 2011 issue of Cultural Anthropology, Jocelyn Lim Chua examines mental health experts’ suicide prevention efforts amongst middle class Malayali children and the underlying social anxieties around modern parenting in Kerala. She demonstrates how anti-suicide training is meant to inculcate children with the value of restraint in order to ward off consumerist impulses. Chua contrasts this “pathology of the elite” and the ensuing desire for privileged children to postpone material gratification with the experiences of Malayali migrants being deported from the Persian Gulf, laborers who have no choice but to “bide their time” as a self-preservation technique. By contrasting these two figures, Chua argues that an individual’s cultivated experience of “waiting” reveals their position in the age of late capitalism.
        %p Based on analysis of temporalization, Chua links Malayalis' ambivalence regarding the rapid pace of (post)modernity to a nostalgia for an idealized past in which swadeshi (self-reliance) and communist temperance were valued. Chua argues that the different techniques of “waiting” that are taught to children and migrants are disciplining them to cope with the contingencies of late capitalist conditions that are specific to their socio-economic status. Her essay provides a new perspective on the production of different types of neo-liberal citizens.  Located at the intersection of anthropology and phenomenology, Chua suggests that “waiting” can be both agentive and passive, and the difference reveals the topography of power relations in late capitalism.
        %p Cultural Anthropology has also published essays on consumption, including  Daniel Fisher’s “Mediating Kinship: Country, Family, and Radio in Northern Australia” (2009),  Lieba Faier’s “Runaway Stories: The Underground Micromovements of Filipina Oyomesan in Rural Japan” (2008), Naveeda Khan’s “Of Children and Jinn: An Inquiry into an Unexpected Friendship During Uncertain Times” (2006),  June Nash’s “Consuming Interests: Water, Rum, and Coca-Cola from Ritual Propitiation to Corporate Expropriation in Highland Chiapas” (2007),  Robert Foster’s “The World of the New Economy: Consumers, Brands, and Value Creation” (2007) , and Pun Ngai”s “Subsumption or Consumption?
